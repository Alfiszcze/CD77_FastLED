NeoMatrix_8X8_Sine_Wave

The inspiration for the sine wave code functions and the starting point for sine wave code functions are from posts by Sean Clohesy on FastLED G+ Community. 

A lot of the code to change colors and the time performance code are by Mark Kriegsman of FastLED.

This sketch runs on an Adafruit NeoPixel NeoMatrix 8X8 panel and on an Arduino Uno, an Adafruit Metro Mini, a DFRobot Beetle or a Teensy 3.1 with level shifter.

It uses the FastLED 3.1.1 library and was compiled with the Arduino 1.6.8 IDE.

It is powered by a 5 volt power supply with a 4700 mfd 35 volt despiking capacitor.

There is the two resistor protection circuit (see https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=50434&p=254414&hilit=ws2812.jpg#p254414 and look for ws2812.jpeg) between the CPU data pin and the panel’s data input.

ENJOY!
