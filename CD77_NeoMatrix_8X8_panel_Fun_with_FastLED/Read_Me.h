/*
 * This sketch is running on an Adafruit NeoPixel NeoMatrix 8X8 panel 
 * with an Arduino Nano and with the FastLED library and uses 
 * the Arduino 1.8.7 IDE.  It can also be run on a Teensy 3.1 or 3.2 with a shift leveler, 
 * on a ESP-8266EX MCU (e.g. Wemos D1 Mini Pro) with a shift leveler or 
 * on a ESP 32 wroom MCU (e.g. Lolin D32 MCU) with a shift leveler. 
 * It uses arrays and arrays of arrays with new functions that allow 
 * you to have some fun with the NeoMatrix panel. It is powered by a 5 volt power supply 
 * with a 4700 mfd 35 volt despiking capacitor. There is the two resistor protection circuit 
 * (see https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic... and look for ws2812.jpeg) between the Nano data 
 * out pin and the Matrix data in. 
 * 
 * ENJOY! Chemdoc77
