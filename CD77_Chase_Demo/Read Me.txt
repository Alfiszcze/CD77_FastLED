Read Me – Chase Demo by Chemdoc77

The following code contains chase animation both for symmetrical and unsymmetrical chase animations.  The user can chose a single color, a color from an array of colors or a series of colors from a palette for the color of the pixels in the color chase bar.  The user can chose the number of pixels in the color chase bar.

Look at the READ_ME.h tab in the code for further explanation of this sketch.

This code is inspired and partially based on code by Zaphod Beeblewurdle in:

This sketch was run with a Wemos D1 Mini Pro MCU on a NeoPixel Strip.  It was compiled using the Arduino 1.8.3 IDE along with the latest version of FastLED.  It also runs well on a Teensy 3.1, 3.2 or 3.6 with a level shifter, or on an Adafruit Metro Mini.

It is powered by a 5 volt power supply with a 4700 mfd 35 volt despiking capacitor.

There is the two resistor protection circuit (see https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=50434&p=254414&hilit=ws2812.jpg#p254414 and look for ws2812.jpeg) between the CPU data pin and the strip’s data input.

ENJOY!
