Read Me – Strobe by Chemdoc77

This sketch shows my CD77_ Strobe functions that work with CRGBSet arrays.

Here is a video of the sketch on YouTube:

This sketch contains the code to made CRGBSet arrays along with key variables that automatically divide a strip of any length LEDs into 2, 3, 4, or 6 equal parts as seen in lines 19 thru 85 of:

This sketch was run with on a Teensy 3.2 with a level shifter.  It was compiled using the Arduino IDE 1.8.10 and the Teensyduino 1.46 (for the Teensy 3.2) along with the latest version of FastLED.  

It is powered by a 5 volt power supply with a 4700 mfd 35 volt despiking capacitor.

There is the two resistor protection circuit (see https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=50434&p=254414&hilit=ws2812.jpg#p254414 and look for ws2812.jpeg) between the CPU data pin and the ring’s data input.

It was run on a NeoPixel, i.e WS2812B, strip inside a 5 foot PEX pipe.

ENJOY!
