Police_lights

The following sketch uses modified police_lightsONE and police_lightsALL animations from Funkboxing by Teldredge.  It uses either the color array concept by Richard Bailey from FastLED G+ Community or FastLED palettes to change colors.  It uses Mark Kriegsman’s of FastLED time performance code.  

This was run with a Metro Mini MCU.  It was compiled using the Arduino 1.8.1 IDE along with the latest version of FastLED.  It also runs well on a Teensy 3.1 with a level shifter or on a DFRobot Beetle.

It is powered by a 5 volt power supply with a 4700 mfd 35 volt despiking capacitor.

There is the two resistor protection circuit (see https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=50434&p=254414&hilit=ws2812.jpg#p254414 and look for ws2812.jpeg) between the CPU data pin and the panel’s data input.

ENJOY!
